CLOUD COMPUTING by Matin (frm Knowledge centre):
-----------------

-Internet base computing.
-Computer resources(Computer, n/w, servers, storage, application and services) can be provisioned and released with minimal efforts.
-CDN(content delivery network)...eg. Jquery and Bootstrap

-Private Cloud(cloud in premises)
	Eg. FreeBird in persistent( is a hybrid cloud , we can connect to AWS/Azure through it) developed on open stack technology.

- Seperate cloud platform in AWS called GREEN GRASS(free IOT with 1 million free messaging).

-Amazon was first introduced Cloud in 2006. Google and IBM are late comers to this field.

Cloud...?
Cloud 1.0				Cloud 2.0					Cloud 3.0						Cloud 3.0+
visual m/c				- Application				-Automation						-Open Standard
(IAAS)					- Databases					-Configuration					-Cluster friendly
						(SaaS, PaaS)				-Managed Services				-AI
													-API Management					-IOT
													-Serverless						-BlockChain
													-Microservice					-More managed services
													-Container
													
													
-Virtual desktop created on Azure cann't move to Azure. Open standards are working on this.

2006-AWS-charges per minute	==>	2010-Azure- charges per hour	==>	2014-GCP(Google cloud platform)-charges per second


-DataCentres(should be maintained at low temp to cool down servers....generally data centre maintained at 6-10 degree Celsius)



SaaS: Software as a Service.
PaaS: Platform as a Service.
IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service.
FaaS: Function as a service
CaaS: container as a Services
DaaS: Data as a service
XaaS: Everything as a service


AWS Works :
> Build (software)
> Migration(software/hardware)
>Integration(taking from multiple sources and bringing under single umbrella of cloud)




Don't treat ur server as a pet, Use it as use and throw material.
